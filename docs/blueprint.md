## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Electric blue (#48A8FF) to mirror the brand's core identity and neon aesthetic.
- Background color: Dark gray (#1A1A1C) to provide contrast and highlight neon elements. Dark mode is preferred, and content can be placed in boxes or other container elements for increased legibility.
- Accent color: Vibrant orange (#FEB549) used strategically for call-to-action buttons and interactive elements to grab attention.
- Headline font: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for a modern and geometric style.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) as this pairs well with Poppins and will render well across browsers.
- Use minimalist, custom-designed icons with neon outlines to enhance the visual theme.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout with generous whitespace to ensure content is easily scannable and visually appealing. Use modern, high-quality lifestyle imagery.
- Hero Section: Before the gallery or the AI design, create a visually impactful hero section with a strong headline, clear subtitle, primary CTA, and a visual element. Titular Fuerte: A headline that solves a problem or highlights a benefit, for example: Turns your idea into an incredible neon sign.
